General comments
----------------------------------------

WOW! This was such a wonderful final project.
I basically have no complaints about it. The
problem you picked was a good (and fun!) one.
The code is nicely written, and you presented
your results in a visually effective way in your
final paper.

One really interesting thing that can be done
(if you're bored at some point!) is to tack
on an optimization problem. In other words,
you've solved the backwards problem for Blue,
trying to infer the location of Red. But now
that there's this information available to
Blue, what's the best strategy? You answer
this is a semi-qualitative way in the discussion
in Section 3, but you can take this to the next
level by wrapping this in the context of
decision theory. All you'd have to do is to
wrap your game in a big loop where you run
lots of Monte Carlo simulations where Red and
Blue try out lots of different strategies.
(Blue should feel completely comfortable
doing this: when appropriate, forward simulations
are perfectly acceptable even to truly
committed Bayesians!) This lets you try out
a bunch of complicated things, e.g., different
strategies for Red depending on whether he
knows Blue is trained in the Art of Bayes.

It was really a pleasure having you in the
class this term. Best of luck, and I hope
you have a relaxing and enjoyable summer!

Best,
Adrian
